In Customized tours, the customer can choose any destination, and accordingly, the tour price is calculated and the bill is printed. In Group tours, we provide the customer with three different categories – Short Trips, Treks & Hikes and Women’s Special. Among these categories, there are different destinations which the customer can choose. According to the tour package selected by the customer, the tour price is calculated and the bill is printed.
